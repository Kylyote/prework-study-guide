# EdX Coding Bootcamp Prework Study Guide Webpage

Very simple webpage that lists introductory webpage coding concepts such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are also notes that go into use on Git and GitHub. This will be added to in the future to better cement coding concepts as the course progresses. The notes here will be further supplemented with notes written in a notebook as the actino of writing has some merit in being able to better remember a subject.
